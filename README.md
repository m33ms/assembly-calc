Create a simple calculator that has the following menu:

A – ADD

S – SUB

N – NEG

Q – Quit

 

Input option: A

Input number: 11

Ans = 11

Input option: S

Input number: 5

Ans = 6

Input option: N

Ans = -6

Input option: A

Input number: 10

Ans = 4

Input option: Q

 

Have the program print the menu once and have your answer set to zero (can't trust it). Then use the CHARI to input the command and the DECI and DECO to input and output the answer. You'll have to use the conditional branches, of course.
